          You find yourself in a forgotten chamber deep beneath the castle, a place whispered about only in hushed tones: the Astrolabe of Worlds. In the center of the room, floating above a pedestal of polished obsidian, is a colossal, shimmering map of the known magical world.
        </MagicParagraph>
        <MagicParagraph>
          As you draw closer, drawn by a faint hum of ancient magic, a script of liquid silver flows across the surface of the map, forming a message meant only for you:

        <div className="mt-6 p-6 border-2 border-purple-600/60 bg-black/90 rounded-lg shadow-[0_0_20px_rgba(147,51,234,0.6)] text-center">

            "Behold this grand Orrery, a marvel of enchanted craft. It shows the world in its entirety, yet it is blind. It knows the ley lines of the earth and the passage of the stars, but it does not know the wizard who stands before it. It is a window to everywhere, yet it is bound to this very room.
            <br /><br />
            The final enchantment, the one that holds the true secret, cannot be unlocked by a magic so vast and impersonal. It requires a more intimate bond. The path forward will only reveal itself through a charmed slate you carryâ€”one that knows your touch.
            <br /><br />
            Only when this world is viewed through such a personal glass will the warmth you seek finally reveal its location."
